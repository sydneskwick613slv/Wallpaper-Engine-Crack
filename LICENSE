FUNCTIONAL

Wallpaper Engine transforms your desktop with dynamic, interactive backgrounds. You can choose from millions of wallpapers in the Steam Workshop, including videos, animated 2D/3D scenes, websites, and even applications. The app lets you create playlists for automatic rotation and customize wallpapers with its built-in editor.

It's designed to be resource-efficient: it automatically pauses when you run a game or use a full-screen app to save system resources. It also supports ultra-wide monitors and syncs with Razer Chroma or Corsair iCUE for matching RGB lighting.

You can even use it on your Android phone via the free companion app to take your wallpapers on the go.
